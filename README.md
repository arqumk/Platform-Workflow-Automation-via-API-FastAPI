#  Automating Manual Workflows on Platform

---

## Project Overview

This project was about saving **time and sanity**.

Our client had two critical but painfully manual workflows on their internal platform. These jobs required multiple steps, preparing data, formatting it, and data entry, and were being done **manually**, often taking **days to complete**.

I helped automate both workflows end-to-end by using the platform’s APIs and turning the process into **10-minute jobs**, triggered via **FastAPI endpoints**.

---

## The Manual Pain Points

Each job had similar bottlenecks:

1. Analysts would extract platform data, clean it manually in Excel  
2. They’d format it to match the required formats  
3. Enter data manually (one by one)  
4. Repeat until complete (sometimes over 5–7 days per job)

It was slow, error-prone, and impossible to scale as volume grew.

## Our Automation Strategy

We approached this with a clean and modular automation pipeline:

-  **Data Preparation with Pandas**  
   - Loaded and cleaned raw data  
   - Mapped it to required fields using dictionary lookups and rules  
   - Generated API-ready payloads in batchable chunks

-  **Platform Integration via API**  
   - Reverse-engineered API patterns from the platform  
   - Authenticated and hit the relevant endpoints in controlled batches  
   - Handled rate limits, retries, and logging

-  **FastAPI Service Layer**  
   - Built simple REST endpoints (`/run-job-1`, `/run-job-2`) to trigger both automations  
   - Allowed scheduling, testing, and extensibility from day one

## Results

-  **Two formerly manual jobs are now fully automated**
-  **Each runs in under 10 minutes** — down from 5–7 days
-  **Zero manual intervention required**
-  Reduced errors and improved consistency across submissions
-  Freed up analysts to focus on meaningful work instead of formatting spreadsheets

## What I Learned

- How to navigate and leverage poorly documented APIs  
- How small automations can have **huge business impact**  
- The value of thinking like an engineer *and* a user when designing automation
